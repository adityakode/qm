# e2e

`run-test-e2e` executes tests for qm software using [podman quadlet](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman) as platform.
For running the tool is required to run as **root** as the nested containers will need privileges to change limits settings.

Demo:
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/cwnb6RjckO7vXLUvHpbMA9fAU.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/cwnb6RjckO7vXLUvHpbMA9fAU)

## Requirements

A recent version of Fedora or CentOS9 with the following packages: bash, selinux and podman.
Make sure to enable `cgroupv2`.
Enable the following on host machine before installing podman
[hirte_repo](https://github.com/containers/qm/blob/main/tests/e2e/ContainerFile.template#L44-L45)

## Tests executed

The idea behind the test is: create isolated environments using technologies like containers, podman (quadlet), selinux and cgroupv2. On top of that, make sure all systemd services in the nodes are controlled remotely taking advanced of [hirte](https://github.com/containers/hirte/).

## Running using containers

By default the tool will create three containers, `control`, `node1` (both running on the host) and the third container will be running on top of `node1` which is called `qm`. In other words, this will be a **nested container environment**.

In a short description, the container control is the **hirte controller**, `node1` and `qm` are the **hirte agents**. After the three nodes are installed and properly configured will be executed several tests scenarios focused in managing systemd remotely using hirte.

## Running using virt

Not developed yet.

## Env variables

There a few env variables that can be set to change the tool behavior.
Just call `export VARNAME=foobar` before executing the script.

| Name                     | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NUMBER_OF_NODES          | Increase the number of agent nodes. Useful for scale tests.       |
| NET_INTERFACE_IP_CONTROL | By default is eth0. Used to collect ip address of controller node |
| TAG_CONTROL_MACHINE      | The control machine tag. Default is control:latest                |
